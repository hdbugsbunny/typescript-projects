Definition :- Generics in TypeScript allow you to create flexible, reusable, and type-safe components by enabling functions, classes, and interfaces to work with a variety of data types without sacrificing type safety.
Generics are especially powerful when you need to write code that works with different data types while ensuring correctness and avoiding redundancy.

Why Use Generics?
1. Reusability: Write code once and use it with any type.
2. Type Safety: Catch type-related errors at compile time.
3. Clean Code: Avoid duplicating similar logic for different types.
