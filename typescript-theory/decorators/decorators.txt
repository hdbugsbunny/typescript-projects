Definition :- Functions that can be used to modify/change/anything different properties/methods in the class.

Points :-
1. Not the same as JavaScript decorators
2. Used inside/on classes only
3. Understanding the order in which decorators are ran are the key to understanding them

Decorators on a property, method, and accessor :-
1. First argument is the "prototype" of the object
2. Second argument is the key of the property/method/accessor on the object
3. Third argument is the property descriptor
4. Decorators are applied when the code for this class is ran (not when an instance is created)
