Definition :- Functions that can be used to modify/change/anything different properties/methods in the class.

Points :-
1. Not the same as JavaScript decorators
2. Used inside/on classes only
3. Understanding the order in which decorators are ran are the key to understanding them

Decorators on a property, method, and accessor :-
1. First argument is the "prototype" of the object
2. Second argument is the key of the property/method/accessor on the object
3. Third argument is the property descriptor
4. Decorators are applied when the code for this class is ran (not when an instance is created)

Property Descriptor for Methods :-
1. writable(boolean) -> Whether or not this property can be changed
2. enumerable(boolean) -> Whether or not this property get looped over by a "for...in"
3. value -> The current value of the property
4. configurable(boolean) -> Property definition can be changed and property can be deleted
