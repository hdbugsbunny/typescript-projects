Definition :- Typescript tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to i.e., typescript guesses the type

Eg., const color = "red";
variable declaration :- const color
variable initialization :- "red"
If declaration and initialization are on the same line, Typescript will figure out what type of value a variable refers to

When to use? Always!!!

any Type :-
1. A type, just as 'string' or 'boolean' are
2. Means TS has no idea what this is - can't check for correct property references
3. Avoid variables with 'any' at all costs
