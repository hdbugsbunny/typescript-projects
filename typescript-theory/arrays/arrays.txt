Definition :- Arrays where each element is some consistent type of value

Why do we care?
1. TS can do type inference when extracting values from an array
2. TS can prevent us from adding incompatible values to the array
3. We can get help with 'map', 'forEach', 'reduce' functions
4. Flexible - arrays can still contain multiple different types

When to use?
Any time we need to represent a collection of records with some arbitrary sort order
