# TypeScript Teams Stats

## What is an Enum?

Enums (short for "enumerations") in TypeScript are a way to define a set of named constants. They allow you to create meaningful names for numeric or string values, making your code more readable and maintainable.

## When to Use Enums?

1. Follow near-identical syntax rules as normal objects
2. Creates an object with the same keys and values when converted from TS to JS
3. Primary goal is to signal to other engineers that these are all closely related values
4. Use whenever we have a small fixed set of values that are all closely related and known at compile time
